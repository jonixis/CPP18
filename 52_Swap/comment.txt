The assembly code generated with the command "gcc -S -o source.s source.cpp" differ only in the name of the swap functions (see diff.s). This means the compiled versions of swap(int&,int&) and c_swap(int*,int*) are executed the same way. Therefore it does not matter if you perform this operation via references or via pointers.
